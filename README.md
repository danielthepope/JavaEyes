JavaEyes
========

This is JavaEyes, a program that lists processes matching criteria and adds up how much RAM they're using.

It was originally designed to count Java processes, but within 4 hours of my first commit I decided it should be able to find whatever processes you want, to answer the question of, for example, "*HOW* much RAM is Chrome using!?"

The name 'JavaEyes' will remain, because I think it's pretty cool anyway.
